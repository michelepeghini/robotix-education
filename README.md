# Robotix 

This is the entire codebase for [Robotix Education](https://robotix.com.au), an educational / e-commerce website that I have developed. 
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my coding skills. 
I did this website pro bono to gain some experience and I am maintaining it and adding new features upon client request.
All code in this repository has been written by me without the use of any templates. 

## Getting started

This is an edited copy of the live website with omitted API keys and changed passwords. 
It is not meant for deployment, this repository is missing all images, downloadable file assets and the database provided is structure only. 
As mentioned earlier, it is meant to showcase my coding skills and not to provide a usable product.
